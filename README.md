# APCS.Final
Our goal is to create a top-down multiplayer shooter. The player has 2 dimensional movement independent of it's shooting direction, which can only be in one of the 4 cardinal directions from the player.
The game will be a team death match with 2 teams, ninjas vs pirates, who shoot shuriken and their guns respectively.
with enough servers, the game could become a multiplayer online system.
The primary feature of the game is the low latency multiplayer shooter experience.
